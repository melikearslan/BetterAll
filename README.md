# BetterAll: an application that will encourage people to follow a healthy life routine. üå± 
Amongst all the age groups, maintaining good health and wellbeing is the most essential component of living. What contributes the most to health and wellbeing is the good quality of sleep, nutrition, and exercise. There are plenty of diets applied worldwide which are under the influence of genetic and environmental factors. Since everyday life is a rush, people are willing to ignore the proper ways of being nourished. It can be said that most humans assuage their hunger as soon as possible by choosing food without considering its nutritive values. Moreover, consuming junk food is a fast and easily accessible option which is a much worse habit than checking food and nutrition indicators before consuming. However, if these types of diets are applied regularly, the negative outcomes of malnourishment are observed. 

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), at least 2.8 million people die each year as a result of being overweight or obese. Furthermore, being overweight or obese causes an estimated 35.8 million (2.3%) of global disability-adjusted life years [1]. In addition to obesity, there are other various forms of malnutrition, such as wasting which is known as low weight-for-height [2]. An indicator to determine malnourishment is the Body Mass Index (BMI). Which is defined as a person‚Äôs weight in kilograms divided by the square of the person‚Äôs height in meters (kg/m2). The ideal value of an individual‚Äôs BMI should be between 18.5 and 24.9 [3]. Maintaining a healthy BMI value is not only done utilizing nutrition but it is also done by being physically active. Insufficient physical activity is one of the leading risk factors for noncommunicable diseases and death worldwide. Being physically active comes with significant health benefits and contributes to preventing noncommunicable diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes. However, globally, 25% of adults are not active enough and more than 80% of the world's adolescent population is insufficiently physically active [4].

Since a healthy mind is a healthy body, as a group of senior students, we are determined to develop an application named ‚ÄúBetterAll‚Äù. As a result, we are aiming to raise awareness about wellness by encouraging people to follow a healthy life routine. Every single individual is unique. Therefore the routines will be based on personal recommendations that are generated with the machine learning algorithm.
